## Notebooks

- `Notebook 1: EDA, Basic Feature Engineering, and Baseline Models (XGBoost and LGBM)`:   
  This notebook focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset, basic feature engineering, and the reproduction of two baseline models: XGBoost and LGBM.

- `Notebook 2: Advanced Feature Engineering using Polars and CatBoost Model`:   
  This notebook builds upon the work presented in the notebook (https://www.kaggle.com/code/carnozhao/cpu-catboost-baseline-using-polars-inference).   
  It explores further feature engineering using the Polars library and utilizes the CatBoost model for prediction.

Please refer to the respective notebooks for detailed code and explanations.
